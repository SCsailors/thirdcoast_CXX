/**
 * Controls a swerve drive wheel azimuth and drive motors.
 *
 * <p>The swerve-drive inverse kinematics algorithm will always calculate individual wheel angles as
 * -0.5 to 0.5 rotations, measured clockwise with zero being the straight-ahead position. Wheel
 * speed is calculated as 0 to 1 in the direction of the wheel angle.
 *
 * <p>This class will calculate how to implement this angle and drive direction optimally for the
 * azimuth and drive motors. In some cases it makes sense to reverse wheel direction to avoid
 * rotating the wheel azimuth 180 degrees.
 *
 * <p>Hardware assumed by this class includes a CTRE magnetic encoder on the azimuth motor and no
 * limits on wheel azimuth rotation. Azimuth Talons have an ID in the range 0-3 with corresponding
 * drive Talon IDs in the range 10-13.
